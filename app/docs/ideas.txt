Ideas

-Main screen (or one of main screens) should be list of searches; areas etc.
that way the list of properties can be very specific to an area, not just the one area.
eg. St John's Downtown, Cape Broyle.

-Work on data mining project at same time to analyse the price changes over the last year etc.
Could include a NN that we embed in the app that can tell the user whether a property is a decent
price.
